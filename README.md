Hello Github,
This is my first repository, courtesy of the Github tutorial. Very excited to start my epic journey programming, creating, and
learning. I am passionate about all things technology, and am looking forward to a career filled with innovation and
experience. My first language I began studying on CodeAcademy, Python, I hope to be finished with the intro class by the end
of April. Starting in May, I will be learning SQL, Java, HTML, and continuing Python. I am looking at getting certified in
MCSE and/or CompTIA.
